## About The Project

Lending-Blockchain is an innovative application designed to streamline the loan process through EduChain, leveraging a decentralized approach. By integrating blockchain technology, it ensures secure, transparent, and efficient loan management, making the entire process more accessible and trustworthy for both lenders and borrowers. With Lending-Blockchain, educational financing is revolutionized, providing a seamless and decentralized solution for managing student loans

## Built With

Loan-blockchain is built using NextJs

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)
- [BunJS](https://bun.sh/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" >Git</a> is a distributed version control system used for software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, keeping track of changes and managing versions. It also enables users to revert changes and collaborate more effectively.

<a href="https://bun.sh/">BunJS</a> is a JavaScript runtime, package manager, test runner and bundler built from scratch using the Zig programming language. It was designed by Jarred Sumner as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. Bun uses WebKit's JavaScriptCore as the JavaScript engine, unlike Node.js and Deno, which both use V8.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShivaBhattacharjee/lending-blockchain
```

```
cd lending-blockchain
```
